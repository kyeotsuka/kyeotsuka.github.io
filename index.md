I’m a BSc (Hons) Cyber Security and Forensic Computing graduate from the University of Portsmouth (2022–2025), awarded First Class Honours. I have a strong foundation in digital investigations, systems security, and broader computing principles. I’m particularly interested in applying my technical and analytical skills across a range of IT and tech-related roles — whether that involves solving security problems, supporting infrastructure, or working on software and systems. I’m adaptable, methodical under pressure, and motivated by work that has real-world impact.
