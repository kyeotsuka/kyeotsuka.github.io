I’m a BSc (Hons) Cyber Security and Forensic Computing student at the University of Portsmouth (2022–2025). With a strong foundation in digital investigations and systems security, I’m deeply committed to understanding and countering cyber threats. My core interests include digital forensics, malware analysis, and cyber threat intelligence. I thrive in environments where I can investigate complex problems and deliver clear, evidence-based solutions. What drives me is the real-world impact of digital security — protecting data, uncovering digital evidence, and maintaining trust in a digital world. I bring strong problem-solving skills, meticulous attention to detail, and a calm, analytical mindset under pressure.
