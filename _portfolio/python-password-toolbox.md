An object-oriented Python tool to securely generate complex passwords, create passphrases, and analyze password strength.

**Role:** Co-developed with Michael Aiwekhoe, with equal contributions across the project lifecycle.

**Tools:** Python (OOP, secrets, collections.Counter, string)

**Challenges:** Designing a flexible object-oriented structure to decouple the password data model from the generator and checker services. Implementing nuanced strength-checking logic to accurately score both complex passwords and multi-word passphrases, accounting for factors like character variety and entropy.
