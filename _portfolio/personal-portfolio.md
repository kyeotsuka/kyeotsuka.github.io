A modern, professional portfolio built with the Jekyll static site generator to showcase my technical projects and skills. The site is designed to be clean, easy to navigate, and fully responsive.

**Role:** Sole Developer

**Tools:** Jekyll, SCSS, Liquid, Markdown, HTML5

**Challenges:** The main challenge was learning the Jekyll ecosystem, including its directory structure and the Liquid templating language. Customising the SCSS to override the theme's default styling required careful inspection of the original stylesheets. Setting up the development environment in Visual Studio Code and ensuring a smooth deployment pipeline with GitHub Pages also presented a valuable learning curve.
