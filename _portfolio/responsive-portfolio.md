A clean, single-page portfolio website built from scratch to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. The site is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.

**Role:** Sole Developer

**Tools:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid), vanilla JavaScript

**Challenges:** Implementing a mobile-first, responsive navigation menu with a smooth slide-in animation. A key challenge was debugging a subtle layout shift caused by the hamburger icon's changing dimensions, which was resolved by enforcing a fixed size on the button to stabilise the header height during the icon swap.
